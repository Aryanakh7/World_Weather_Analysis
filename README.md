# World_Weather_Analysis

## Analysis Description 

The purpose of this analysis is to upgrade the already existing app, in order to maximize user satisfaction and to increase the performance of the system. By adding the weather description to the previously retrieved weather data, beta testers will be able to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary, and by using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map will be created to further assist the beta user and to facilitate their travel experience.

## Analysis Results 

As seen on the map below, a user is capable of creating a map with markers according to their weather preferences.

Once that preference has been been defined, the user will select and create an itinerary showing the travelling route by driving, bicycling or walking. The next step is to find and select hotel information from the data provided by the cities' geographical locations.

As seen on the map above, an itinerary has been created for a traveller wanting to drive to the Malaysian coastal cities of Kuala Terengganu and Georgetown, the city of Sattahip in Thailand, and the Southern Vietnamese city of CÃ  Mau. The user will also be able to see the hotel names as well as the weather description and the maximum temperature.

The world has so much to offer and the functions mentioned above will hopefully enable travellers to discover more world locations efficiently and in an organized way.

Happy Travel!
